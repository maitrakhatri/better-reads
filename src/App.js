      author: "Bhagat Singh",
      description: "Bhagat Singh is a name that became synonymous with revolution in Indiaâ€™s struggle for independence. This young boy brought about a change in the way people thought about freedom. He was well read and fought extensively for rights â€“ his own, his comradesâ€™ and his countrymenâ€™s. A discussion with a friend soon turned into a matter of self-assessment for Bhagat Singh, leading to a discourse on why he chose to be an atheist. Even in the face of death at a very young age, his uncanny observation leads to his putting forth some pertinent questions. On another occasion, he was disappointed with his fatherâ€™s plea in Court for his innocence and chose to write a letter to him. This book is a collection of eighteen of his valued writings from within the walls of prison and outside it, which show us the resolve in his words, and the bravery in his acts subsequently.",

These are symbolic presentations of the thoughts of truths that need to be conveyed. The concepts in the book are inspired by the revolutionary art, establishment of empires etc. The book is segmented into three parts decanted into the Brahma-Saraswati, Vishnu-Lakshmi and Shiva-Shakti. It features these gods or goddesses in simple and attractive prose and the reference has been taken from the Vedas and Puranas. Indeed it's an amazing collection for reader.",
